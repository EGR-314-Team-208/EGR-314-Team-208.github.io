                    <!-- Content for User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements section goes here -->
                    <p>We identified our user needs by conducting research on products that are on the market. By combing through the pages of reviews, five stars to one star, we were able to distill what the user was looking for in a mobile weather station. Our team specifically picked out smart fans and anemometers as a market to pursue and from what we gathered, the user needs were apparent. By going through the reviews of popular and unpopular wind devices, we identified sore spots or highlights the consumer continuously pointed out in their reviews. We took these pain points and praises, separated out the fluff and kept what was relevant to us, dividing this data up into two categories, Latent and Explicit. Explicit being more easily identifiable pain points and Latent being points that are more difficult to pin down as to why they're frustrating. We then took these points and turned them into specifications from where our product can draw its strengths from. To ensure these specifications our design will revolve around we will constantly be referring to our list of product requirements to make sure we incorporate them in our product. Our product requirements list is our most purest form of user needs that relate specifically to our device and with this list we can asses our device according to it. Some standout requirements included the device should withstand extreme heat and cold temperatures, the device is made from durable material, the device should include an emergency switch and the device should have intuitive user control. The focus of our project is in creating a device capable of reading wind speed and temperature and using the information to heat or cool the room. For the full list of product requirements and user needs they can be found in the appendix.</p>

                    <h2>Design Ideation</h2>
                    <!-- Content for Design Ideation section goes here -->
                    <p>Every team member played the key role in the design process, we each came up with a list of ideas for a design concept which was bounced around. We used a couple of different brainstorming methods including mind mapping, figure storming, rapid ideation and analyzing customer reviews. Everyone was able to pitch their ideas and we voted on which would be the best device for our group and the projects scope. We then took these ideas and ranked them with a 3 star system, 1 being the least important and 3 being the most important. Then we created a concept of our device around the ideas we ranked so we can have the most variety and originality as possible in our device. The concepts can be found in the appendix.</p>

                        <!-- Content for Selected Design section goes here -->
                        <p>The design we decided to pursue was the fan concept. We chose it for a few reasons including its simplicity. The aim of our group is to produce a product that adheres as closely to the product requirements and and user needs as possible which is attainable with the simplicity of the concept. Another reason we chose the fan was because it showcases all the strengths and weaknesses of each subsystem making debugging and testing easier in the later stages of the project.</p>

                    <p>The wind speed sensor and motor subsystem interface through the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol, enabling efficient data exchange and control. Meanwhile, the temperature sensor operates using the I2C protocol, providing accurate temperature readings. The microcontroller serves as the central orchestrator, managing communication between all subsystems and interfacing with the ESP32 for broader connectivity. This collaborative approach ensures a cohesive integration of diverse functionalities, leveraging distinct communication protocols for optimal performance and fulfilling the overall project objectives effectively.</p>
