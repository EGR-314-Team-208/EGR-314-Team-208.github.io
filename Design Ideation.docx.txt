Create three product concept sketches
Product 1:


It consists of blades attached to a central hub, which, when powered by a motor, rotates to move air. It has adjustable speed settings, allowing users to control the intensity of the airflow. Additional features include oscillation, where the entire unit or head can move from side to side for even air distribution, a tilt function for adjusting the angle of the fan head, and a remote control for convenient operation.
  
  

  Product 2:
For our second product we decided on a self-closing-blind, using a temperature sensor and a Humidity temperature sensor, with the temperature sensor whenever it is hot outside (user settings temp) the blinds would go down and whenever the temperature is cool (user setting temp) the blind would go up. Basically a device set at the top corner of a window, a motor controlled by the sensor and the Wi-Fi feature allowing the user to open or close blinds.


  

  



Product 3:
For our final product we decided on the Smart-Sprinkler, equipped with a motor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and Wi-Fi control, making gardening by enabling precise watering schedules based on real-time weather conditions, convenient smartphone management, and promoting water conservation. The temperature sensor and the humidity sensor work together to determine when it would be most effective to water any plants. The Wi-Fi control allows for the user to have full control over the sprinkler, if for some reason they decide that they should not water their plants that day or if the sprinkler should only be facing one direction.
